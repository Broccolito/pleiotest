\title{Run AMATZ Pleiotropy Test}
\usage{
run_amatz(pleio)
}
\arguments{
\item{pleio}{An object of class `pleio`, containing summary statistics for genetic variants.}
}
\value{
A `data.frame` with AMATZ-derived p-values for each variant.
The row names correspond to variant identifiers.
}
\description{
Applies the `AMATZ` method from the `MTARclone` package to evaluate pleiotropy significance.
The method uses z-scores computed from effect size estimates and standard errors.
}
\details{
The function extracts effect size (`beta`) and standard error (`SE`) matrices from the `pleio` object,
computes z-scores, and estimates their correlation structure.
The `AMATZ` method from `MTARclone` is then applied to test for pleiotropy.

\examples{
result <- run_amatz(pleio)
