\title{Run WI Pleiotropy Test}
\usage{
run_wi(pleio)
}
\arguments{
\item{pleio}{An object of class `pleio`, containing summary statistics for genetic variants.}
}
\value{
A `data.frame` with `WI`-based p-values for each variant.
The row names correspond to variant identifiers.
}
\description{
Applies the `WI` method from the `MPAT` package to assess pleiotropy.
}
\details{
The `WI` (Weighted Integration) method combines association signals across multiple correlated traits using a weighted approach.
It accounts for correlation and assigns weights to different phenotypic associations.

result <- run_wi(pleio)
