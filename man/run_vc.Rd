\title{Run VC Pleiotropy Test}
\usage{
run_vc(pleio)
}
\arguments{
\item{pleio}{An object of class `pleio`, containing summary statistics for genetic variants.}
}
\value{
A `data.frame` with `VC`-based p-values for each variant.
The row names correspond to variant identifiers.
}
\description{
Applies the `VC` method from the `MPAT` package to assess pleiotropy.
}
\details{
The `VC` (Variance Component) method models genetic effects as a variance component across multiple correlated traits.
It estimates the shared genetic contribution across phenotypes and tests for significant pleiotropy.
}
\examples{
result <- run_vc(pleio)
