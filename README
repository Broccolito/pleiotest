## Testing of Simulated Pleiotropic Genotypes and Phenotypes

### Overview

The `pleiotest` package provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating pleiotropy in simulated genetic data. It includes multiple statistical methods for testing the association of genetic variants with multiple correlated traits, leveraging a range of model-based and data-driven approaches. 

Key features include:
- Multiple pleiotropy tests, such as `MixFisher`, `MixVar`, `MixTippett`, `MixSD`, `PCMinP`, and `PCLC`
- Integration with [`pleiosim`](https://github.com/Broccolito/pleiosim) for simulating pleiotropic genotypes and phenotypes
- Utilization of summary statistics from GWAS-like studies
- Support for correlated traits and network-wide association studies

This package is designed for researchers studying the genetic basis of complex traits and diseases.

## Installation

To install the development version of `pleiotest` from GitHub, you will need **`devtools`**:

```r
# Install devtools if not installed
install.packages("devtools")

# Install pleiotest from GitHub
devtools::install_github("your-github-username/pleiotest")
```

### Dependencies

`pleiotest` depends on several R packages, including:
- [`MPAT`](https://github.com/Broccolito/MPATclone)
- [`MTARclone`](https://github.com/Broccolito/MTARclone)
- [`pleiosim`](https://github.com/Broccolito/pleiosim)

If these are not automatically installed, you can install them manually:

```r
devtools::install_github("Broccolito/MPATclone")
devtools::install_github("Broccolito/MTARclone")
devtools::install_github("Broccolito/pleiosim")
```

---

## Usage

### Load the Package

```r
library(pleiotest)
```

### Example: Running a Pleiotropy Test

#### 1. Simulate Pleiotropic Data with `pleiosim`

```r
library(pleiosim)

# Simulate pleiotropic genotypes and phenotypes
sim_data = pleiosim::simulate_pleiotropy(n_snps = 1000, n_traits = 5, n_samples = 500)
```

#### 2. Apply Pleiotropy Testing Methods

```r
# Run MixFisher with Davies approximation
result_mixfisher = run_mixfisher_davies(sim_data)
head(result_mixfisher)

# Run MixVar with Liu-modified approximation
result_mixvar = run_mixvar_liumod(sim_data)
head(result_mixvar)

# Run MinP test
result_minp = run_minp(sim_data)
head(result_minp)
```

#### 3. Combine and Interpret Results

```r
library(dplyr)

# Merge results from different methods
results_combined = dplyr::bind_cols(
  result_mixfisher,
  result_mixvar,
  result_minp
)

head(results_combined)
```
