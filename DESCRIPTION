Description: The `pleiotest` package provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating pleiotropy in simulated genetic data. It includes multiple statistical methods for testing the association of genetic variants with multiple correlated traits, using a range of model-based and data-driven approaches. The package supports various pleiotropy tests, including `MixFisher`, `MixVar`, `MixTippett`, `MixSD`, `PCMinP`, and `PCLC`, among others. These methods leverage summary statistics from GWAS-like studies and account for the correlation structure among traits. The package integrates with `pleiosim` to simulate pleiotropic genotypes and phenotypes, making it a valuable tool for benchmarking pleiotropy detection methods. `pleiotest` is particularly useful for researchers studying the genetic basis of complex traits and diseases.
